#   - Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
#   - Capitalize the subject line
#   - Do not end the subject line with a period
#   - Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   - Can include multiple paragraphs in the body
#   - Can use bullet points (use - or * for bullets)
